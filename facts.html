		<li>I am the youngest and only daughter in our family.</li>
			<br>
			<center><img src="11.jpg" height="300" width="200"/></center>
			<br>I the left you could see my father, Perfecto L. Perez a retired MSgt. (Master Sergeant) in the AFP and is 55 year
			old. Next to my father is my only brother, John Vincent M. Perez he is 1 year and 3 months older than me. Currently, he is a 4<sup>th</sup> mechanical engineering student
			in TIP. Next is me, and my mother Marilou M. Perez, a factory worker; you can see that I am looking at my brother fiercly in the picture it is because before the picture was 
			taken we are arguing on something. The photo was taken in our recognition day in elementary. My family is my strenth, they are the most important treasure in my life. We may
			no be expressive in our feelings but I know that we love an care for each other.
		<br/><li>I am the only one in our family who have this curly hair.</li>
			<br/>Most of my relatives tell me that I inherited my hair from my grandmother's mother, her name is lola Andrea or Andeng as people call her. But the truth is that when I was
			I was two years old, my parents decided to cut my hair and make me bald because they believed that my hair will grow straight after cutting it but the opposite happened. From
			wavy my hair become curly.
		<br/><li>I don't eat COOKED carrots, only raw.</li>
			<br/>I don't know when it started but eating cooked carrots makes me feel nauseous; I feel like I am eating a finger because of its crunchiness and softness.
		<br/><li>I don't eat other flavor of instant noodles aside from beef flavor and I don't eat pancit canton.</li>
		<br/><li>I can't sleep without a blaknket covering at least half of my body.</li>
			<br/>I can't really remember when I developed this mannerism of me but one of my professor before told me that maybe I have security issues or problem and this is one of the way
			of coping with the problem.
		<br/><li>Most people often think of me as a dyke but in fact I am not, I grew up with a brother and 7 male cousins and I have adpated their actions and other behavior.</li>
		<br/><li>I loved to play guns, tops, yoyo, remote control cars and physical games rahter than dolls.</li>
			<br/>I am really boyish, my friends often tell me that they thought I was a lesbian because of my actions and my behavior. I grew up surrounded mostly of men, my only playmate was my
			brother who taught me these games which I enjoy because most of this games require to use physical strength.
		<br/><li>I love to watch horror movies but I don't like morbid scenes.</li>
			<br/>Horror movies give me adrenaline rush because of the thrilling scenes and I prefer horror movies than the morbid ones especially those with people eating other people. There is one
			time where I have watched cannibals, after the movie I haven't had the appetite to eat for 3 days.
		<br/><li>I am more masculine in terms of behavior than my older brother.</li>
			<br/>Most of our relatives regard me as a male and my brother as a female it is because he is vain and meticulous than me. He loves to take care of his skin; he buys different skin care
			products, facial products and sometimes he uses concealer to conceal his pimple scars while I on the otherhand is contented in washing my face twice a day with soap. He is also more
			conscious of his looks more than me.
		<br/><li>Aside from serving in the youth community, I am also R.O.C.K facilitator of Kids For Christ (KFC).</li>
			<br/>R.O.C.K means Reaching Out Christ To Kids, just like YFC, KFC aims to evangelize children from 3 to 9 years old to introduce God to the children. Serving to kids also became one of
			my passion because it is really heart warming to see children singing and dancing for God. Serving in the YFC and KFC community brings me joy internally and externally, especially to kids
			because they could teach us things about life too, their innocent view in life and their honesty are those that I admire ti the children. I remember one time, I ask the children what are
			their opinion about better world, this one particular kid answered which really touched me she said that <em>"Ate hindi ko po alam, pero masaya po siguro ang mundo kung lahat nagmamahalan
			yung puro laro lang po, yung palaging masaya. Kasi ate ganun naman po diba? Kung wala lang pong naghahangad ng mas higit siguro po masaya lahat."</em> Their innocence taught me to view life
			simply and to worry less.
