						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing up, it became hard for me to discover what talent I have because that time I don't really know what I like to do. When I reached 12
						that was the time where I learned how to play the guitar and that was one of my happiest moment in life because I discovered that I can still do 
						some thing. This is also a way for me to give back all the glory to the Lord who have given me this wonderful talent and opportunity to praise and 
						worship Him. I always make sure that every time I got the chance to play guitar for Him I would put all my heart, soul and pour eveything I can to 
						thank Him. I would like to share my talent to you that is why I recorded myself playing the song "When you say nothing at all" by Ronan Keating.
						Enjoy listening!

						<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also discovered that I could write a poem when I was in grade 6. Writing a poem lightens up my mood because it serves as a tool for me to
						vent out my frustrations and all my stress. I would like to share a poem I originally made, hope you'd enjoy reading this one. I made this poem
						in my freshmen year in college.

						<br/>Were just walking on a boring street tonight
						<br/>There is nothing really special about this night
						<br/>It's boring because you're not talking at all
						<br/>But when I feel you beside me, I fall
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
						<br/>But I'm a demon, you're an angel
						<br/>You're from heaven, I'm from hell
						<br/>I am selfish and you are selfless
						<br/>You are light and I am darkness
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
						<br/>We won't fit we're so different
						<br/>I just wish you'll listen to the words I want to say
						<br/>That tonight I fell in love with you angel
						<br/>So would you just forget the heavens and stay with me?
						<br/>You are the most beautiful to me.
