						<br><font face="Calibri" color="#000000" size="5pt">Watching does not only entertain me, it also makes me feel relaxed and at ease.
						Watching became my hobby since I was infected with chicken pox, I was bored because I can't go out to play for a week so I watch and watch
						and watch until I realize that tv shows entertain me especially anime channels. I started watching Korean drama since 2008, K-drama helps me
						to reduce stress from school and it is also my way to escape from reality for a limited time. Watching also teaches me valuable life lessons
						that I can apply in life. Watching also influenced me to adapt some attitudes from the characters which I admire. For example saying expressions
						like <em>Sugoi</em> Japanese word for amazing. <em>Daebang</em> Korean word for amazing. <em>Konichiwa or Annyeong Hasaeyo</em> Japanese and Korean
						word for hello in greeting people.</font></br>

						<li>Reading books, e-books and wattpad.</li>

						<br><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="5pt">I started reading during 2<sup>nd</sup> high school. I started reading e-books 
						because a friend suggested it to me, she give me a copy of several stories and after I've finished reading I realized that the stories bring
						me joy so I continued reading until I discovered novels which challenged me a bit because I'm not fond of reading long novels it makes me feel
						sleepy but after reading my first novel enitled "Everyday", a novel about a boy's soul transferring from different body. After reading the novel,
						I realized it was not boring at all, in fact it was really entertaining. WAttpad is my favorite reading material, I have already read more than
						20 stories which I find very interesting and entertaining because it contains relatable quotes. Reading also reduces my stress.</font></br>
						<br><li>Playing guitar.</br></li>
						<br><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="5pt">Playing guitar is one of my best way to relieve stress, music makes me feel calm every
						time. This is also my medium to express my feelings when I am happy, lonely, angry or overwhelemed. It also helps me in boosting confidence I myself
						especially when I am with my band, I feel like a different person when I play in stage. This is also a way for me to give back all the glory to the Lord
						who have given me this wonderful talent and opportunity to praise and worship Him. I always make sure that every time I got the chance to play guitar for
						Him I would put all my heart, soul and pour eveything I can to thank Him.</font></br>

						<br><li>Eating.</br></li>
						<br><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="5pt">I bet a lot of people can relate to me with this hobby. Eating is one of the most effective
						and most common way to relieve stress, there is a thing called <u>"stress-eating"</u> where people eat to reduce stress and feel better. Eating makes me
						feel happy and satisfied, especially sweet and salty foods. Eating sweet foods like chocolates makes our body release a hormone called serotonin which is
						known as a happy hormone that sends signal to our brain that makes us more happier and feel better.</font></br>
						<br><li>Hanging out with friends.</br></li>

						<br><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="5pt">Friends are the family we chose to have. It is also said that friends are our siblings from
						another mother; friends for me are one my my greated treasure in life aside from my family and education. They are my stress reliever and my best medicine
						especially when I feel down. I love to spend time with them. They are my food buddies, acad buddies and my partners in crime.</font></br>
