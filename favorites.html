					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! Hello! Thank you for exploring on my web page! I will be sharing to you my favorites from my favorite colors to other things. 
					I hope you could relate with me after reading this.</br>
					<p><img src="red.jpg" height="500" width="300" align="left"/><!--Default-->
					First of all I want to share with you that red is my favorite color, for me red symbolizes power, bravery and love. I have read 
					an article stating that our favorite color reflects our personality; according to colorgraphic, people who loves red is a passionate
					person, they exude powerful energy where your presence can easily be feel by others. People who loves red loves a lot, they are very 
					expressive; they do not hold grudges and likes to move on quickly because they always look forward on what is next. They love adventure
					and lead people with optimism. Most of these are true to me especially being expressive.</p>
					<br>Second, my favorite flower is buckwheat and tulips. I love tulips because it symbolizes love and respect, it really touches me when
					someone gives me a tulip flower. I recently discovered buckwheat flower when I was watching a Korean drama entitled Goblin, buckwheat flowers
					for me means infinity because of its tiny petals which you cannot count.</br>
					<br>Third, I would like you to know that Kuroko no Basket and Kataekyo Hitman Reborn are my favorite anime among all animes I've already
					watch since my childhood days. Funny fact is that I re-watched those two animes a couple of times but I never feel <em>"sawa"</em> on watching
					these two. Even though Hitman Reborn has 204 episodes.</br>
					<p><img src="knb1.jpg" height="450" width="300" align="right"/><!--Default-->
					This anime is entitled Kuroko no Basket, this is about Kagami who loves to play basketball, wanting to beat the other 5 prodigies in basketball, 
					the Generation of Miracles: Kise, Midorima, Aomine, Murasakibara, and Akashi by the help of the 6<sup>th</sup> phantom man Kuroko. This anime
					shows the value of friendship and teamwork that inspires me.</p>
					Lastly, I want to share to you that I have lots of Korean Drama favorites because almost all of their dramas are very relatable and heartfelt.
					I started watching Korean drama last January of this year and I've already finished 17 dramas. The list of the Korean Drama I have finished are enumerated
					follows: Descendants Of The Sun, Legend of the blue sea, Cinderella and the 4 knights, Love in the moonlight, Scarlet heart, Dream high, Secret garden, 
					My love from the star, Goblin, Weight lifting fairy Kim Bok Joo, Life of Kang Chi, Oh my Venus, My girlfriend is a gumiho, Queen In Hyun's man, My shy boss, 
					Oh my ghost, and 7 first kisses.</p>
					<p><img src="7.gif" height="300" width="500" align="middle" valign="center"/>
					This drama is entitled Goblin, a story about a warrior on the Georyo era punished by the deity that only his bride can remove the sword from his
					chest so that he could die and be in peace. After 900 years of searching, he found her bride but things does'nt go well with what he originally planned he
					learned to love his bride and sacrificed his life for his love but in the end his bride still die but she reincarnated to continue their love.
